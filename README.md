## Details

### The Premise

You are the CTO of a company which manages Campuses and Enrollments. Create a RESTful web platform that allows you to manage your students and campuses. Before getting started, please carefully review the expectations as outlined below.

### The tools

For this project, you must use Express to handle HTTP requests and Sequelize to interface with your database. Likewise, you must use React, Redux and React-Redux on the front-end. This means that all important state (i.e. students and campuses) must be managed by the Redux store (unimportant state, like form data, may be managed by stateful React components). Components that display student/campus data should therefore be connected to the Redux store. 

- other client side libraries you will need
- redux toolkit (and thunks)
- react-redux
- react-router-dom (v6)
- axios

### Requirements + Rubric (see rubric file)

## Requirements

- the application needs to be deployed
- the application needs to load without errors (blank screens are not acceptable)
- do not copy and paste previous code!
- you will have ample time to complete project, NO EXTENSIONS WILL BE GIVEN
- build incrementally! 
- if you have an error, fix the error, before attempting to **add** functionality

## Other Important Info

### Video Walkthrough
Please submit a short, 5 minute screencast of a walk-through of the functionality for each user story in your app. E.g. for "As a user, I can create a project", you can fill out the form for creating a project and then see the new project appear in the projects list. *There is no need to show us the code you wrote.* We recommend using Quicktime to record the screencast (instructions on how to do that [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5882?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)).

Once you've recorded your screencast, please *upload it to YouTube as an unlisted video*. **Include a link to the video in your repo's README** and include your repo link in the video description. This will aid us in evaluating your submission.

Well before the deadline, we recommend practicing this by recording a very short screencast and uploading it as an unlisted video. If you encounter any technical issues, reach out to us so that we can help you resolve them.
